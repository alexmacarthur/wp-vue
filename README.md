# WP Vue

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexmacarthur/wp-vue.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alexmacarthur/wp-vue)

This is just a simple Vue blog that displays posts from a WordPress REST API endpoint. Clone or fork this sucka & rip it apart to suit your own needs. If you have ideas to make it better for everyone else, contribute!

## Install

1. Make sure you have `yarn` installed on your machine, and run `yarn install`.
 
## Usage

### Set Your Constants
Set your specific constants in the `config.js` file.

* `REST_ENDPOINT` - The WordPress REST API endpoint from which data will be pulled. Leave off the trailing slash. Example: `https://blah-blah-blah.com/wp-json/wp/v2`
* `POSTS_PER_PAGE` - The default number of posts per page that will be displayed.
* `GA_TRACKING_ID` - A Google Analytics tracking ID.
* `REQUEST_CACHE_MAX` - The maximum number of AJAX requests that will be cached in memory.

### Spin Up Locally
Run `yarn run dev` to spin up a running version from localhost.

### Build for Production
Run `yarn run build`.

### Deploy to Netlify
Netlify is amazing, so if you're in need of somewhere to host your own version of this project, I highly recommend it.

## Caching
Out of the box, WP Vue will locally cache AJAX requests in memory, and then load them as needed. This first happens on page load, when all queried posts on the current and adjacent pages are cached for quick access later. 

To keep things from getting out of control, a maximum request cache value is set. Once your cache reaches this max (regardless of how large each request is), the first request in memory will deleted as a new one is added. So, you shouldn't have to worry too much about an insane amount of data being locally stored as you move through posts.

Manually reloading the page will kill this cache. It will not persist. 

## Set Endpoint via URL Parameter
If you'd like to share link to a version of WP Vue that uses a different endpoint than what's set via the code, you can pass that endpoint in as a URL parameter: 

Example: 
`https://wp.netlify.com?endpoint=https://css-tricks.com/wp-json/wp/v2`

Instead of using the default, this will use whatever endpoint you provide in the URL.
